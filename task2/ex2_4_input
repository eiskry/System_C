I hope that you live your life--each precious day of it--with joy and
meaning. I hope that you walk without pain--and that you are grateful
for each step.

And when the challenges come, I hope you remember that anchored deep
within you is the ability to learn and grow. You are not born with a
fixed amount of resilience. Like a muscle, you can build it up, draw
on it when you need it. In that process you will figure out who you
really are--and you just might become the very best version of
yourself.

Class of 2016, as you leave Berkeley, build resilience.

Build resilience in yourselves. When tragedy or disappointment strike,
know that you have the ability to get through absolutely anything. I
promise you do. As the saying goes, we are more vulnerable than we
ever thought, but we are stronger than we ever imagined.
